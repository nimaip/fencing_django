# Fixing FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED on Vercel

## Problem
The Django application was crashing with `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` because:
1. **URL routing** was still pointing to the original `views.py` with OpenCV/MediaPipe imports
2. **Django middleware** was too complex for serverless environment
3. **Template rendering** might have been causing issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated URL Routing
- Changed `fencing_app/urls.py` to use `vercel_views` instead of `views`
- Added health check endpoint for debugging

### 2. Simplified Django Settings
- Removed problematic middleware:
  - `SessionMiddleware` (not needed for simple app)
  - `AuthenticationMiddleware` (not needed for simple app)
  - `XFrameOptionsMiddleware` (can cause issues in serverless)

### 3. Created Minimal Views
- `home()` view now returns HTML directly instead of using templates
- Added `health_check()` endpoint for debugging
- Simplified `analyze_pose()` to work without file system operations

### 4. Removed Dependencies
- Updated `requirements.txt` to only include Vercel-compatible packages
- Removed OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy

## Files Modified

1. **`fencing_app/urls.py`**:
   ```python
   from . import vercel_views  # Changed from views
   ```

2. **`fencing_app/vercel_views.py`**:
   - Added `health_check()` function
   - Simplified `home()` to return HTML directly
   - Removed template dependencies

3. **`fencing_project/settings.py`**:
   - Simplified middleware stack
   - Removed session and authentication middleware

4. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Removed OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy
   - Kept only web-compatible packages

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED - simplify Django for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Vercel
In your Vercel dashboard:
```
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
DEBUG=False
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Test the health check endpoint: `https://your-app.vercel.app/health/`

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Health Check
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/health/`
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Django app is running on Vercel"
}
```

### 2. Home Page
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
Expected: Simple HTML form for pose analysis

### 3. Pose Analysis
Upload an image and test the analysis endpoint

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Getting FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
**Solution**: Check Vercel logs for specific error messages
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Functions → View logs
2. Look for Python import errors or missing dependencies

### Issue 2: Template Errors
**Solution**: The home view now returns HTML directly, bypassing templates

### Issue 3: Database Errors
**Solution**: SQLite database is read-only on Vercel
- The app doesn't use database operations, so this shouldn't be an issue

### Issue 4: File Upload Issues
**Solution**: File uploads are handled in memory, not saved to disk

## Alternative: Even Simpler Approach

If you're still having issues, try this minimal approach:

### 1. Create `api/index.py` for Vercel
```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

def handler(request, context):
    return JsonResponse({
        'message': 'Django app is working on Vercel!',
        'status': 'success'
    })
```

### 2. Update `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/index.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Test All Endpoints**:
   - Health check: `/health/`
   - Home page: `/`
   - Pose analysis: `/analyze/`

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check function execution times
   - Monitor memory usage

3. **Consider Improvements**:
   - Add error handling
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add rate limiting

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
vercel logs your-project-name
```

### Test Locally
```bash
vercel dev
```

### Deploy Manually
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Health Check**: Returns JSON response
2. **Home Page**: Shows simple HTML form
3. **Pose Analysis**: Returns mock analysis results
4. **No More Crashes**: Functions should execute successfully

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Simplify Further**: Remove more middleware and dependencies
3. **Use Alternative Platform**: Consider Heroku or DigitalOcean for full functionality
4. **Contact Support**: Vercel support can help with specific deployment issues

The key changes made should resolve the FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error by removing all problematic dependencies and simplifying the Django configuration for serverless deployment.
