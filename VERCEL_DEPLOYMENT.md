# Vercel Deployment Guide for Django Fencing Project

## Why Vercel Deployment Gets Stuck

The deployment gets stuck on "Deploying outputs" because:
1. **OpenCV and MediaPipe** have native dependencies that don't work in Vercel's serverless environment
2. **Memory limits** are exceeded during the build process
3. **File system limitations** prevent proper installation of these libraries

## Solution: Mock Analysis for Vercel

I've created a Vercel-compatible version that:
- Removes OpenCV and MediaPipe dependencies
- Provides realistic mock analysis results
- Uses only web-compatible Python packages
- Maintains the same user interface

## Files Modified for Vercel Deployment

### 1. `requirements.txt`
- Removed: `opencv-python-headless`, `mediapipe`, `numpy`
- Kept: `Django`, `Pillow`, `python-dotenv`, `whitenoise`, `requests`

### 2. `fencing_app/vercel_views.py`
- New file with mock pose analysis
- No OpenCV/MediaPipe dependencies
- Returns realistic feedback based on pose type

### 3. `fencing_app/urls.py`
- Updated to use `vercel_views` instead of `views`

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment with mock analysis"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in or create account

2. **Import Your Repository**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Select the fencing project

3. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Other" or "Python"
   - **Root Directory**: Leave as `/` (root)
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty (Vercel will auto-detect)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty
   - **Install Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-strong-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=False
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click **Deploy**
2. Wait for the build to complete
3. Your app will be available at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## Testing the Deployment

### 1. Home Page
- Visit your deployment URL
- Should show the fencing pose analysis form

### 2. Pose Analysis
- Upload an image
- Select pose type (En Garde or Lunge)
- Click "Analyze Pose"
- Should show mock analysis results

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Form works correctly
- Image upload succeeds
- Mock feedback is displayed
- Note about mock analysis is shown

## Limitations of Vercel Deployment

### What Works:
- ✅ Web interface
- ✅ Image upload
- ✅ Mock pose analysis
- ✅ Realistic feedback
- ✅ Base64 image display

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Real pose detection
- ❌ OpenCV image processing
- ❌ MediaPipe pose estimation
- ❌ Actual angle calculations

## Alternative Deployment Options

For full functionality with OpenCV and MediaPipe:

### 1. Heroku
- Better support for native dependencies
- More generous memory limits
- Writable file system

### 2. DigitalOcean App Platform
- Excellent for ML applications
- Good OpenCV support
- Reasonable pricing

### 3. Google Cloud Run
- Containerized deployment
- Good for complex applications
- Scalable

## Local Development

To run with full OpenCV/MediaPipe functionality locally:

1. **Install full dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

2. **Switch to full views**:
   ```python
   # In fencing_app/urls.py
   from . import views  # Instead of vercel_views
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Stuck on "Deploying outputs"
**Solution**: 
- Check that `requirements.txt` doesn't include OpenCV/MediaPipe
- Ensure `vercel_views.py` is being used
- Check Vercel logs for specific errors

### Issue: Mock Analysis Not Working
**Solution**:
- Verify `fencing_app/urls.py` imports `vercel_views`
- Check that the form submits to `/analyze/`
- Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working
**Solution**:
- Ensure variables are set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Redeploy after adding environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **For Demo/Prototype**: Use Vercel deployment with mock analysis
2. **For Production**: Deploy to Heroku or DigitalOcean for full functionality
3. **For Development**: Use local setup with full dependencies

## Commands to Deploy

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Vercel deployment ready with mock analysis"
git push origin main

# Vercel will automatically deploy from Git push
```

The deployment should now complete successfully without getting stuck on "Deploying outputs".
